# BLE IMU Device - XIAO nRF52840 Sense + LSM6DS3

This project streams real-time accelerometer and gyroscope data over **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** using a **Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840 Sense** and an **LSM6DS3 IMU** sensor. It transmits 6-axis motion data (Accel + Gyro) at 50Hz to a BLE central device such as a smartphone or PC.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Bluetooth LE advertisement and data streaming
- Sends data as comma-separated values: `accelX, accelY, accelZ, gyroX, gyroY, gyroZ`
- Uses BLE service UUID `19B10000-E8F2-537E-4F6C-D104768A1214`
